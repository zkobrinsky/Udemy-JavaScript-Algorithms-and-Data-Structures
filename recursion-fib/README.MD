<p>Write a recursive function called <strong>fib</strong> which accepts a number and returns the <em>n</em>th number in the Fibonacci sequence. Recall that the Fibonacci sequence is the sequence of whole numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ... which starts with 1 and 1, and where every number thereafter is equal to the sum of the previous two numbers.</p>
