<p>Write a function&nbsp;<strong>factorial</strong> which accepts a number and returns the factorial of that number. A&nbsp;factorial is the product of an integer and all the integers below it; e.g., factorial four (&nbsp;<em>4!</em>&nbsp;) is equal to 24, because 4 *&nbsp;3&nbsp;* 2 * 1 equals 24.&nbsp;<strong> factorial zero (0!) is always 1.</strong></p>
